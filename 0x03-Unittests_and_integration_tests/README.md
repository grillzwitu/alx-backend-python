# 0x03-Unittests_and_integration_tests

Unit testing is the process of testing that a particular function returns expected results for different set of inputs. A unit test is supposed to test standard inputs and corner cases. A unit test should only test the logic defined inside the tested function. Most calls to additional functions should be mocked, especially if they make network or database calls.
  
  The goal of a unit test is to answer the question: if everything defined outside this function works as expected, does this function work as expected?
  
  Integration tests aim to test a code path end-to-end. In general, only low level functions that make external calls such as HTTP requests, file I/O, database I/O, etc. are mocked.

Integration tests will test interactions between every part of your code.

Execute your tests with

`$ python -m unittest path/to/test_file.py`

`$ python -m unittest test_utils.py`

# Tasks

## [0. Parameterize a unit test](./test_utils.py)

Create a `TestAccessNestedMap` class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`.

Implement the `TestAccessNestedMap.test_access_nested_map` method to test that the method returns what it is supposed to.

Decorate the method with `@parameterized.expand` to test the function for following inputs:

```
nested_map={"a": 1}, path=("a",)
nested_map={"a": {"b": 2}}, path=("a",)
nested_map={"a": {"b": 2}}, path=("a", "b")
```

For each of these inputs, test with `assertEqual` that the function returns the expected result.

## [1. Parameterize a unit test](./test_utils.py)

Implement `TestAccessNestedMap.test_access_nested_map_exception`. Use the `assertRaises` context manager to test that a `KeyError` is raised for the following inputs (use `@parameterized.expand`):

```
nested_map={}, path=("a",)
nested_map={"a": 1}, path=("a", "b")
```

Also make sure that the exception message is as expected.

## [2. Mock HTTP calls](./test_utils.py)

Familiarize yourself with the `utils.get_json` function.

Define the `TestGetJson(unittest.TestCase)` class and implement the `TestGetJson.test_get_json` method to test that `utils.get_json` returns the expected result.

We don’t want to make any actual external HTTP calls. Use `unittest.mock.patch` to patch `requests.get`. Make sure it returns a `Mock` object with a `json` method that returns `test_payload` which you parametrize alongside the `test_url` that you will pass to `get_json` with the following inputs:

```
test_url="http://example.com", test_payload={"payload": True}
test_url="http://holberton.io", test_payload={"payload": False}
```

Test that the mocked `get` method was called exactly once (per input) with `test_url` as argument.

Test that the output of `get_json` is equal to `test_payload`.

## [3. Parameterize and patch](./test_utils.py)

Read about memoization and familiarize yourself with the `utils.memoize` decorator.

Implement the `TestMemoize(unittest.TestCase)` class with a `test_memoize` method.

Inside `test_memoize`, define a class `TestClass`
Use `unittest.mock.patch` to mock `a_method`. Test that when calling `a_property` twice, the correct result is returned but `a_method` is only called once using `assert_called_once`.
